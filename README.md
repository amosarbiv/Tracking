### Why implementation in python, when [C++ code](https://github.com/davheld/GOTURN) is already available?

* Easy to understand the overall pipeline of the algorithm in detail
* Easy to experiment new ideas
* Easy to debug and visualize the network with tools like [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom)
* Little effort in portability to other OS

### Functionalites added so far
- [X] Training the deep network on Imagenet and ALOV dataset

- [X] Test code for VOT
